# Strict Fibonacci Heaps
    
A Python 3 implementation of the data structure "Strict Fibonacci Heaps", by Gerth St√∏lting Brodal, George Lagogiannis, and Robert E. Tarjan.
To appear in Transactions on Algorithms.

The implementation is by no means supposed to be efficient. Its main purpose is to support the correctness of the paper. A comprehensive set of assertions check for the structural integrity of the data structure during the execution.
